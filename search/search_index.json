The AI Forum for Criminal Justice has been estbalished to address, the interests of universities and colleges on the one hand and practitioner s on the other, as well as the legal technologists who facilitate innovation and safe operation of AI. There will be over lap. Universities and colleges Firstly, legal research both for students and tutors is enabled and enhanced by artificial intelligence. Unlike a normal Library system the user will be able to interrogate on specific interests and ask for points for consideration. The system gives access to vast resources of digital documents, for example, Bench books, trail data, case data, legal guidelines and rules. Whereas a traditional digital law Library will contain just source material, artificial intelligence will allow interrogation, interaction and analysis on behalf of the user. This will assist research for current matters as well as future possibilities. Turning now to the training of future advocates and court users, artificial intelligence can create court room environments. It can for example, supply informed roles for a prosecutor, defence advocate, and defendant. The areas of law can be supplied as to the syllabus. Each of the roles could replicate real life and the rules of evidence and procedure rules will be covered. The scenario can be judged by a real judge or by a tutor or other experience person. It\u2019s even possible for AI to create a judge, but of course it will be digital and not have human characteristics necessarily. This exercise will also train the user in the use of AI. This a great advocacy training utility. Depending on the data supplied by the user and the interrogation of the artificial intelligence by that user, performance feedback strategies and future consideration points can be acquired. It is possible if not using role-play, for artificial intelligence to actually create an AI witness, Advocate, Judge et cetera which can also include some hearing characteristics which will be reflected in the language by the AI witness. Advocates and judges AI will be much more constructive than any law Library. It can supply the law for that particular case and apply it to the facts of that case depending on the requirements of the user. They can produce suggestions for closing speeches, opening speeches and summing up. In case preparation and for examination or cross examination, AI can suggest strategies and content. It can analyse large amounts of documentation for example and give points of discrepancy, points of coincidence and in fact practically everything that you would have had to have done by reading and a piece of paper. It is hoped that complex fraud and murder cases for example with large amounts of data and documents can be analysed in minutes. Legal technologists Legal technologists play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between technology and legal practice, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to transform how legal professionals operate. By integrating AI into various legal processes, legal technologists can streamline workflows, enhance data management, and improve access to legal resources. Their expertise allows for the development of innovative tools that facilitate the automation of routine tasks, such as document review and contract analysis, thus freeing up valuable time for legal practitioners to focus on more strategic aspects of their work. Furthermore, legal technologists can leverage AI to create user-friendly platforms that not only support legal research but also provide insights derived from vast datasets, enabling practitioners to make informed decisions quickly. As AI continues to evolve, the contributions of legal technologists will be essential in ensuring that technology aligns with legal standards and ethical considerations, ultimately fostering a more efficient and equitable justice system. Going forward The AI will continually be subject to do data collection and should be therefore contemporary this at all times. We hope to show that AI can create learning games for example quizzes to help understand legal issues and law. Above all the AI will keep a supervisory look at legal ethics and standards and point out any possible breaches. Data protection and security will be front and foremost. This will apply during any training exercises as well as real life research.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview-ai-forum-for-criminal-justice","text":"Simple overview of our aspirations for artificial intelligence (AI) in the current justice system.

These standards define how data should be structured, formatted, and validated, promoting uniformity across various components within the schema. Key Data Standards The following data standards are applied across CJS to maintain high-quality data management: 1. Data Types Each field within the schema is assigned a specific data type. The most applicable Elasticsearch data types used in the schema include: keyword : Used for structured text that does not need to be analyzed, such as case identifiers, legal codes, and participant roles. It is ideal for exact matches, sorting, and aggregations. text : Applied to unstructured text that may contain free text, such as witness statements, case descriptions, or legal documents, allowing for full-text search capabilities. date : Applied to fields that store date values, following the DD-MM-YYYY format, in compliance with ISO 8601 standards (e.g., offence_date , hearing_date ). geo_point : Used for storing geographical locations such as crime scenes, police station locations, or courthouse addresses, enabling geo-based queries like proximity searches. boolean : Represents binary values ( true or false ), useful for fields such as bail_granted , supervision_required , or detention_status . array : Fields that can store multiple values (e.g., an array of evidence items, participant IDs, or case statuses). 2. Naming Conventions Field names follow consistent naming conventions to ensure clarity and uniformity: Field names are written in snake_case (e.g., person.contact_info , case.outcome ). Prefixes indicate the entity or component to which the field belongs (e.g., case , person , evidence ). 3. Date and Time Formatting Dates are formatted using the DD-MM-YYYY format according to ISO 8601 standards. This format ensures consistency and enables efficient sorting and filtering of date-related data. Example: 15-10-2023 4. Unique Identifiers Each major entity within the Fides framework is assigned a unique identifier (UID) following the format of three letters followed by seven digits (e.g., 0000001) . These UIDs are structured to ensure integrity and traceability of data across different components and follow the order of the entities listed in the schema: Criminal Prosecution Reference ID : CPR1234567 Hearing ID : HRG0000001 Offence ID : OFF0000001 Organisation Unit Identifier (OU ID) : OU0000001 Person ID : PER0000001 Postal Address ID : ADD0000001 Result ID : RES0000001 Result Qualifier ID : REQ0000001 Role ID : ROL0000001 System ID : SYS0000001 Material ID : MAT0000001 These identifiers are used to link related records across different components, ensuring the integrity and traceability of data throughout the schema. 5. Linking and Relationships The schema is designed to establish clear relationships between different entities: Case-Centric Structure : All components, such as persons, offences, evidence, and events, are linked to specific cases using unique identifiers. Cross-Referencing : Fields like related_cases , case_id , person_id , and material_id are used to create relationships between entities, ensuring all relevant information is interconnected. 6. Validation Rules To maintain data integrity, certain fields have validation rules applied: Mandatory Fields : Core fields (e.g., case.id , person.name ) are mandatory and must be provided for each record. Data Type Validation : Fields are validated against their specified data types to prevent inconsistencies (e.g., ensuring date fields contain valid dates). Enumeration Lists : Fields with predefined values (e.g., case.status , person.role ) must match an approved list of values to ensure consistency. 7. Data Privacy and Security The schema incorporates standards to protect sensitive information: Anonymisation : Certain fields may be anonymised to protect the identity of persons, especially for victims and witnesses. Access Control : Data should be stored and accessed following secure protocols, ensuring that only authorised personnel can view or modify sensitive information. Major Entities To support comprehensive and consistent data management, the Criminal Justice Schema (CJS) includes the following major entities: Criminal Prosecution Reference : Links individuals to specific offences with a unique sequence and prosecution details. Hearing : Captures data elements relevant to case hearings, including dates, locations, and outcomes. Offence (Fixed) : Provides detailed information on offences, including CJS codes, legislative context, and indicators for recordability and notifiability. Organisation Unit Identifier : Represents the organisational structure and units within Criminal Justice Organisations (CJOs) accessing the CJS exchange. Person : Describes individuals involved in the justice system, such as defendants, victims, or legal professionals. Postal Address : Details the postal addresses of persons or organisations involved in a case. Result (Fixed) : Defines case outcomes, including interim, partial, or final results.
